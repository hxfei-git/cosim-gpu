# Multi-GPU xGMI Interconnect & Super-Node Scale-Out Implementation Plan

## Goal Description

Extend cosim-gpu from single MI300X GPU co-simulation (QEMU + gem5) to multi-GPU hive simulation with xGMI interconnect modeling (Path A), and eventually to super-node scale-out via SST Merlin network simulation (Path B). The implementation follows a progressive architecture: single-process multi-GPU instances for initial phases (2–4 GPUs), transitioning to multi-process architecture for full 8-GPU hive scale. vfio-user is the sole QEMU ↔ gem5 transport. Path A and Path B can proceed in parallel after the 2-GPU xGMI link model is validated.

### Key Architecture Decisions (Clarified)

1. **gem5 Process Model**: Progressive — single gem5 process with multiple GPU instances for Milestone 1–2 (up to ~4 GPUs); multi-process (one gem5 container per GPU with IPC) introduced at Milestone 3 for 8-GPU scale.
2. **Dependency Relaxation**: SST Merlin integration (Milestone 4) depends only on the 2-GPU xGMI baseline from Milestone 2, NOT on the 8-GPU hive (Milestone 3). Milestones 3 and 4 can proceed in parallel.
3. **Transport Scope**: Multi-GPU uses the standard vfio-user transport exclusively.
4. **Bandwidth Targets**: 128 GB/s per link and ~310–330 GB/s aggregate are configurable model parameters calibrated to real hardware specs, NOT hard pass/fail acceptance criteria. Acceptance is based on correct data transfer and configurable timing, not measured throughput numbers.
5. **Hardware Characterization**: Real hardware benchmarking (TransferBench, RCCL) is recommended for model calibration but not a gating prerequisite for any milestone.
6. **SST PoC**: Milestone 4 includes a lightweight PoC sub-milestone before full integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

Following TDD philosophy, each criterion includes positive and negative tests for deterministic verification.

- **Cannot use**:
  - Additional QEMU ↔ gem5 communication backends
  - gem5 GarnetNetwork for xGMI (designed for on-chip, not inter-chip)
  - Modifications to upstream QEMU source code for multi-device support (use QEMU CLI parameters only)
  - Hardcoded GPU count assumptions (must be parameterized via `--num-gpus`)

## Feasibility Hints and Suggestions

> **Note**: This section is for reference and understanding only. These are conceptual suggestions, not prescriptive requirements.

### Conceptual Approach

**Milestone 1 — Multi-GPU in single gem5 process:**

```
# Pseudocode for mi300_cosim.py extension
for gpu_id in range(args.num_gpus):
    gpu_device = AMDGPUDevice(gpu_id=gpu_id)
    shader = createGPU(system, args, gpu_id)    # CU/L1/L2 per GPU
    vram_shmem = f"/mi300x-vram-{gpu_id}"
    socket_path = f"{args.socket_base}-{gpu_id}.sock"

    cosim_bridge = MI300XVfioUser(
        gpu_device=gpu_device,
        socket_path=socket_path,
        shmem_path=vram_shmem,
        vram_size=args.dgpu_mem_size,
    )
    system.gpu_devices.append(gpu_device)
    system.cosim_bridges.append(cosim_bridge)
```

QEMU side: add N `-device vfio-user-pci,socket=/tmp/gem5-mi300x-{N}.sock` parameters in `cosim_launch.sh`.

**Milestone 2 — xGMI bridge at L2 egress:**

The xGMI bridge intercepts memory requests at L2 cache egress. When the target address falls in a remote GPU's VRAM range, the request is forwarded through the xGMI link model instead of local memory.

```
L2 Cache → [address check] → local VRAM (if local)
                            → xGMI Bridge → Transport → Remote GPU L2 → Remote VRAM (if remote)
```

**Milestone 3 — Multi-process transition:**

Each GPU runs in a separate gem5 Docker container. A synchronization daemon manages global virtual time across all gem5 processes. xGMI transport uses shared memory ring buffers or Unix sockets for inter-process packet delivery.

**Milestone 4 — SST PoC approach:**

Start with a minimal integration: wrap a single gem5 GPU as an SST `SubComponent`, connect to a trivial Merlin network (2 endpoints, single link). Validate that SST's event loop and gem5's event scheduler can co-execute without deadlock or time drift. Only after PoC success, proceed to full 2-GPU integration with three-layer synchronization.

Key dependency changes from original draft:
- Milestone 4 depends on Milestone 2 only (relaxed from original Phase 3→4 dependency)
- Milestone 3 and Milestone 4 can proceed in parallel
- Milestone 5 depends on both Milestone 3 (8-GPU hive validated) and Milestone 4 (SST integration proven)

### Critical Technical Dependencies

- Milestone 1 Section A (gem5 multi-instance) must complete before Section B (QEMU multi-socket)
- Milestone 2 Section A (xGMI spec) must complete before Section B (bridge implementation)
- Milestone 3 Section A (multi-process architecture) is the highest-risk item — it changes the fundamental execution model
- Milestone 4 Section A (PoC) is a gate: if PoC fails, the full SST integration approach needs re-evaluation

## Implementation Notes

### Code Style Requirements
- Implementation code and comments must NOT contain plan-specific terminology such as "AC-", "Milestone", "Step", "Phase", or similar workflow markers
- These terms are for plan documentation only, not for the resulting codebase
- Use descriptive, domain-appropriate naming in code instead

### Architecture Notes
- The transition from single-process to multi-process (Milestone 3) is the most significant architectural change. The single-process model from Milestones 1–2 should be designed with this transition in mind — e.g., xGMI transport should use an abstract interface that can switch between in-process function calls and IPC
- PCI topology: QEMU Q35 chipset has limited root port count. For 8 GPUs, PCIe switches or additional root ports may be needed. Investigate Q35 capacity early in Milestone 1
- amdgpu driver multi-GPU: the cosim environment uses `ip_block_mask=0x67` which disables PSP and SMU. Verify that xGMI topology discovery works without these blocks, or implement a minimal xGMI discovery stub
- Guest RAM shared memory (`/dev/shm/cosim-guest-ram`) is shared across all GPUs; only VRAM is per-GPU
